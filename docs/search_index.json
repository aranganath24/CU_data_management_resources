This brief primer provides an overview of some useful resources at CU Boulder that will help you to implement some of this policy’s main requirements for projects that recieve NIH funding. The NIH policy has three main requirements, which correspond to different stages of the project lifecycle: When first applying for an NIH grant, you must submit a Data Management Plan (DMP). If the grant application is successful, you must implement the data management protocol specified in the DMP, and follow data management best practices as you pursue your research. At the conclusion of your research, you must deposit your research data in a data repository, where other researchers can independently access and download the data. The Center for Research Data and Digital Scholarship, a collaboration between the University Libraries and Research Computing, offers services that can help you to fulfill all of these requirements. This brief primer provides an overview of these services, along with references to helpful external resources. It begins with an overview of data management planning. It then presents [services and resources that can help you to implement data management best practices once your project is underway][Implementation Services], and an an introduction to [repository services][Repository Services] at CRDDS that can help you to publish your project data at the conclusion of your grant. The [conclusion][Conclusion] provides references and suggestions for further reading. "],["an-overview-of-data-management-planning.html", "2 An Overview of Data Management Planning", " 2 An Overview of Data Management Planning A data management plan (DMP) is a short document (~2 pages) that describes your plans for collecting, organizing, storing, and eventually disseminating the data that underlies your published research. Writing a DMP gives you the opportunity to develop a framework for organizing and managing your research data over the lifecycle of the project; putting it in writing helps you to think through various issues that might arise, and approach data management in a deliberate and intentional way, rather than figuring things out as you go in an ad-hoc fashion. Ultimately, this increases the likelihood that research products will be reusable and reproducible. Data management plans are therefore increasingly required by funding agencies as a part of grant applications, and have been a requirement for NSF grant applications for some time now. One of the key features of the NIH’s new DMSP is that a data management plan will now be a requirement for NIH grants as well. The final draft of the template for the NIH data management plan is still in development, and will be released soon. However, the basic outline has already been published on the NIH website, and you can review it there. If you are familiar with NSF data management plans, you’ll notice that the NIH draft template is quite similar. If you are planning to apply for an NIH grant, the easiest way to generate an appropriate data management plan that conforms to NIH requirements is to use an application called DMPTool. DMPTool is a digital platform that provides structured assistance to researchers that would like to craft a data management plan. It allows you to view sample plans that have been completed in the past, and develop new data management plans using DMP templates that correspond to the requirements of the major funding agencies. It also allows for easy collaboration among project teams, including among project teams that are dispersed across multiple institutions. The NIH data management plan template has not yet been added to DMPTool, but will be included by the time the new NIH DMSP goes into effect in early 2023. Below, Section 3 walks you through the main steps involved in creating a DMP using DMPTool. Because the NIH template has not yet been added, the example uses a sample NSF template; note, however, that the workflow will be substantively quite similar for the NIH template (once it’s added). "],["dmptool.html", "3 DMPTool 3.1 Log into your DMPTool account and view your personal dashboard 3.2 Create a new plan 3.3 Customize, Write, and Compile the Data Management Plan 3.4 Download and Export the DMP 3.5 Have someone review the draft DMP 3.6 Revise the DMP 3.7 Submit the DMP", " 3 DMPTool 3.1 Log into your DMPTool account and view your personal dashboard Go to the DMPTool website, and select the option to sign in via the institutional portal: Figure 3.1: Sign into DMPTool via your institution Then, select University of Colorado, Boulder; once you click Go, you will be able to sign in via your Identikey: Figure 3.2: Look up CU Boulder and click ‘Go’ to sign in via IdentiKey This will bring you to your personal DMP Dashboard. Here, you can begin a new DMP; resume working on a saved DMP (in-progress DMPs will show up under the My Dashboard sign if they exist); or view sample DMPs created by other CU researchers (under the banner that reads University of Colorado Boulder Plans) Figure 3.3: Your personal DMPTool dashboard 3.2 Create a new plan To initiate a new plan, click the blue Create plan button (see Figure 3.3), which will bring you to an interface like the one below: Figure 3.4: Initiate a new plan Here, you can provide relevant details about your project, such as its name, the funding organization, and the DMP template that you would like to use. In this example, we’ve named our project “Demonstration”, and have selected NSF and the generic NSF DMP template under the funder and template headings (but, if you’d like to prepare a DMP for an NIH grant, you would select that option once it is available in DMPTool in early 2023). Once you’ve filled out this information, go ahead and click the blue Create plan button, as in Figure 3.4. 3.3 Customize, Write, and Compile the Data Management Plan At this point, we are on a page that looks something like the one below. Note the six tabs running along the top of the page: Figure 3.5: Environment to assemble DMP By systematically working through the various sections associated with these tabs, you will be able to generate a data management plan. Make sure to save your work on the sections as you go. Also, note the Select Guidance section on the right. Make sure that both the DMPTool and University of Colorado Boulder (CU Boulder) buttons are selected. This ensures that as you work through the material within the Write Plan tab, you will be able to see relevant guidance on how to complete various sections of your DMP. In the first tab, Project Details, you can enter your project abstract and some additional information. The second tab, Collaborators, will look like the image below; here, you can invite collaborators to participate in creating the DMP, and regulate their access to the in-progress document. Figure 3.6: Add collaborators Once you’ve invited collaborators (if relevant) and set their permissions, you can click the Write Plan tab, which will bring you to a page that looks like the one below. Each section on this page corresponds to a required section of the DMP (these sections are based on the template that was chosen earlier). Click the + to expand a section and work on it, or click expand all to open all the sections at once. Figure 3.7: Write DMP sections To take an example, let’s expand the Data and metadata standards section, which will look like the image below, once open. We can write (or paste) the text for this section into the text box, and click Save (note that it’s necessary to click Save after every DMP section within the Write Plan tab is completed). Figure 3.8: Completing an individual section within the ‘Write Plan’ tab On the right of the image above, you can view relevant information on a section or advice on how to complete it. To view this information, make sure that the Guidance button is selected (when selected, it will appear white). Once the Guidance button is selected, you’ll see buttons corresponding to different sources. To see instructions from the funding agency (here, NSF) or DMPTool itself, click on those buttons. To see CU Boulder-specific information on completing a given section (i.e. information on CU-specific resources or tools that might be relevant to a given section), click the CU Boulder button. There is CU Boulder-specific guidance for all sections in the Write Plan tab (assuming we’re using the generic NSF template) with the exception of the first section (on Types of data produced). 3.4 Download and Export the DMP After completing the various sections of the DMP within the Write Plan tab, and adding relevant information within the Research outputs tab, you can download your DMP (which is compiled from the information that has been entered in the various tabs), within the Download tab. The Download section will look something like this: Figure 3.9: Download DMP After customizing the plan according to the desired specifications, you can then click Download Plan, at which point DMPTool will generate a complete data management plan in the desired file format (in this case, PDF), based on the text that was entered in the various sections above. When opening up the exported file, it will look something like this: Figure 3.10: Exported DMP opened in new tab 3.5 Have someone review the draft DMP After generating a draft DMP using DMPTool, it is often useful to have someone review and offer feedback on your draft. In particular, we encourage CU researchers to reach out to the Center for Research Data and Digital Scholarship, which has librarians who are able to review DMPs, and offer advice on possible revisions before you submit the plan to the funding agency. To set up an appointment with a CRDDS librarian, please send an email to crdds@colorado.edu. 3.6 Revise the DMP To implement revisions, you can access your DMP (and its various sections) from your personal DMPTool dashboard. Simply click on the relevant project title, and DMPTool will take you back into that project, where you implement necessary revisions to the relevant sections, and then re-export the revised DMP: Figure 3.11: Access DMP from dashboard to make revisions Also, note that it’s not necessary to complete the DMP in one session; so long as you save the DMPTool sections as you go, it’s always possible to return to an in-progress or incomplete DMP from your dashboard, and continue working where you left off. 3.7 Submit the DMP While the specific submission process for the DMP will depend on the funding agency and grant, it’s useful to note that DMPTool provides useful options for publishing and registering your DMP within the Finalize/Publish tab of your project (including the option to generate a DMP ID and add the plan to ORCID): Figure 3.12: Options to publish and/or register your plan "],["sample-dmps.html", "4 Sample DMPs", " 4 Sample DMPs As noted above, DMPTool provides a catalog of DMPs written and used by researchers as part of their grant applications. This searchable archive of previously used DMPs provides additional examples that you may wish to explore. Another useful resource is this annotated example of a DMP in the provisional NIH 2023 format, which has been released by the NIH DMSP Guidance Working Group. Perusing previously-submitted DMPs will give you a sense for the level of detail that reviewers expect in these documents. "],["data-storage.html", "5 Data Storage", " 5 Data Storage In your DMP, you should expect to discuss where and how research data will be stored while your project is ongoing (data storage during an active project is distinct from data archiving for long-term preservation and reuse, which you should also discuss in your DMP; for more on this, see below). Once the project is actually underway, you will need to store data using the active storage plan cited in your DMP. OIT has put together a helpful guide to data storage options at CU Boulder: In most cases, especially if your research data is expected to be less than one terabyte, OneDrive is probably the best storage solution for research data. One drive has been approved for the storage of highly confidential data, and is considered a secure storage environment. If you are working in the realm of “big data”, and need more than one terabyte of storage space, the CU Boulder PetaLibrary is an option that is worth exploring. While you can store data &gt;1 terabyte on the PetaLibrary, note that unlike OneDrive, storing your data in the PetaLibrary involves a cost ($45/terabyte/year), and is not approved for the storage of sensitive or highly confidential data. If you need a secure way to transfer large amounts of data between project team members, CU Boulder’s free Large File Transfer Service is a useful resource. A general principle of data storage and security to keep in mind is the “3-2-1” rule: Keep 3 copies of important data (1 original record, and 2 copies), on 2 different storage environments, with at least 1 copy held physically off-site or in a secure cloud storage environment. "],["data-management-best-practices.html", "6 Data Management Best Practices", " 6 Data Management Best Practices The NIH has assembled an extremely useful guide to data management best practices for active projects. Two topics mentioned in that guide are worth emphasizing: Documentation and Metadata: Documenting your data workflows as you go will make it easier to prepare your data for long-term archiving at the end of your project. For guidance on best practices for data documentation and metadata, this document (from MIT) is a good place to start: https://libraries.mit.edu/data-management/store/documentation. Cornell University Libraries’ brief primer on metadata is also helpful. When you deposit your data in a repository for long term preservation, it is usually a minimal requirement that you at least provide “readme” style metadata. We recommend that you review the sort of information that is typically presented in a data readme file, and document your ongoing work with a view towards creating such a metadata file at the conclusion of the project. File management: Data files can quickly proliferate, and it’s important to have a framework in place that regulates how files and directories are named, organized, and versioned. For a useful primer on file naming and organization conventions, see this resource from the University of Wisconsin: https://researchdata.wisc.edu/file-naming-and-versioning/. "],["data-management-tools.html", "7 Data Management Tools", " 7 Data Management Tools There are a variety of tools available that can help you to implement data management best practices. There are too many to catalog here, but a few worth highlighting: The Unix Shell/Command Line: When creating, naming, deleting, or moving around files and directories, it is easier to keep track of everything if you do so programmatically (rather than pointing and clicking in a graphical user interface). The Unix Shell is a basic scripting tool that allows you to automate these aspects of file management relatively easily: this makes file management quicker, less error-prone, and easier to document. For an excellent tutorial on using the Unix shell for file management, see this lesson from the Carpentries program: https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/. Git and GitHub: Version control is an important part of data management that refers to your approach to tracking changes made to files containing data and code over time. Git is a version control system widely used in the open-source software and academic research communities. Github is a platform for hosting projects and source code that is based on Git; it’s a great way to implement versioning in a collaborative project. GitHub is a particularly useful way to store and keep track of changes in the code and scripts you use to process your data. These scripts can also be submitted alongside your datasets for long-term preservation in data repositories. To get started with Git and GitHub, this lesson is a good place to start: https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/. The Open Science Framework (OSF) is designed to be a one-stop shop for all of your data and project management needs.It integrates various data storage, analysis, versioning, and management applications into one unified platform. "],["crdds-services.html", "8 CRDDS Services", " 8 CRDDS Services CRDDS staff are available to consult on data management issues related to ongoing projects. We host consult hours on Tuesdays (12:00-1:00) and Thursdays (1:00-2:00), which you can sign up for on the CRDDS Events Page. You can also request a consultation outside of those hours by emailing crdds@colorado.edu. CRDDS regularly provides workshops and trainings related to data management (including on some of the tools and best practices mentioned above), which you can also find on the CRDDS Events page. "],["an-overview-of-data-publishing.html", "9 An overview of data publishing", " 9 An overview of data publishing The second main requirement associated with the new NIH DMSP (in addition to the data management plan requirement) is that you publish your project data in a publicly facing data repository. A data repository is effectively an archive that is designed to preserve research data beyond the life of a given project, so that other researchers can easily reuse and build on the work of their colleagues. More generally, data repositories have the goal of making research data FAIR: Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable. There are many different kinds of data repositories within the broader repository ecosystem: General purpose repositories accept data deposits from researchers from various disciplines, regardless of their institutional affiliation. An example of a general purpose repository is the Harvard Dataverse. Disciplinary repositories accept deposits from researchers from designated discipline(s) or research communities, regardless of their institutional affiliation. An example of a disciplinary or community-based repository is the Inter-university Consortium for Social and Political Research (ICPSR), which hosts data from social science researchers. Institutional repositories accept data deposits from researchers who are members of a specific institution, regardless of their discipline or area of research. An example of an institutional repository is CU Scholar, which is CU-Boulder’s own institutional repository. There is no “right” repository for you to archive your data; different repositories have different requirements, different levels of staff support, and different levels of visibility and prominence with various audiences and stakeholders. If you would like to talk through repository options, please get in touch. If you would like to explore some of these options on your own, a good place to start is this catalog of repositories provided by the NIH. "],["repository-services-cu.html", "10 Repository Services @ CU 10.1 Basic CU Scholar Policies 10.2 Submitting data to CU Scholar 10.3 Sample CU Scholar datasets 10.4 CU Scholar size constraints and costs 10.5 Privacy, Ethics, and CU Scholar", " 10 Repository Services @ CU In order to meet the NIH data sharing requirement, you have the option of depositing your data in CU Boulder’s Institutional Repository, CU Scholar. 10.1 Basic CU Scholar Policies If you are thinking of depositing your data in CU Scholar, please review the Data Set Policy (scroll all the way down). Two things, in particular, are worth emphasizing: All of the contributors to a dataset or project do not necessarily have to be affiliated with CU-Boulder, but the person who deposits the data must be employed by CU-Boulder. Once the data is published, it is immediately open-access and accessible to anyone who wishes to download the data. As a result, datasets with personally identifying information are not appropriate for CU Scholar. 10.2 Submitting data to CU Scholar If you decide that you would like to meet NIH data sharing requirements using CU Scholar, please consult the submission guidelines, and the The basic steps of the CU Scholar data submission workflow are as follows: Click the blue “Share Your Work” button on the main CU Scholar page. When prompted to select the type of work, select the “Data Set” option. You will be prompted to fill out several fields, and upload your data. Please also upload a Readme or documentation file that provides relevant metadata. You can access a Readme template under CU Scholar’s Data Set Policy section. Once you have completed the submission, we will review it for adherence to FAIR data principles. We may recommend changes to your submission based on this review. Once the submission has been finalized, we will register a digital object identifer (DOI) for the data, which can be used to uniquely identify the dataset, and provide proof of compliance with the NIH data publication requirement. 10.3 Sample CU Scholar datasets If you would like to see what dataset publications look like on CU Scholar, here are a few recent examples: https://doi.org/10.25810/mzt8-w960 https://doi.org/10.25810/y1f2-j085 10.4 CU Scholar size constraints and costs Finally, a word on size limits and costs. If your data submission is less than 500 GB, we can publish it on CU Scholar ad no additional cost to you. For data submissions greater than 500 GB, there is a one-time data deposit fee of $450/terabyte. For purposes of assessing costs, file sizes are rounded up (for example, a deposit of 750 GB will be assigned a deposit fee of $450; a deposit of 1.4 TB will be assigned a deposit fee of $900; and so on). 10.5 Privacy, Ethics, and CU Scholar As we noted above, all CU Scholar is open data; please make sure that data is appropriately de-identified or anonymized to protect human subjects. We can offer some advice on de-identification, but the responsibility for ensuring that the data is appropriate for public dissemination, and that human subjects are protected, ultimately rests with the depositor. For practical guidance on data anonymization, please see this resource from the UK Anonymization Network. An alternative to anonymization is to deposit your data with a repository that has an infrastructure for restricted-use data. If a repository has a restricted-use option, you will be able to deposit your data, and the depositor will only make the data available to researchers under controlled conditions that guarantee the safety of human subjects. For an example of how restricted-use data generally works, see this example from ICPSR.
