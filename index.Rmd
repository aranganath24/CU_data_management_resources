# Introduction

The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is implementing a [Data Management and Sharing Policy (DMSP)](https://sharing.nih.gov/data-management-and-sharing-policy), which goes into effect on January 25th, 2023. This brief primer provides an overview of some useful resources at CU Boulder that will help you to implement some of this policy's main requirements for projects that recieve NIH funding. 

The NIH policy has three main requirements, which correspond to different stages of the project lifecycle:

1. When first applying for an NIH grant, you must [submit a Data Management Plan](https://sharing.nih.gov/data-management-and-sharing-policy/planning-and-budgeting-for-data-management-and-sharing) (DMP). 
2. If the grant application is successful, you must implement the data management protocol specified in the DMP, and follow [data management best practices](https://sharing.nih.gov/data-management-and-sharing-policy/data-management) as you pursue your research.
3. At the conclusion of your research, you must [deposit your research data in a data repository](https://sharing.nih.gov/data-management-and-sharing-policy/sharing-scientific-data), where other researchers can independently access and download the data. 

The [Center for Research Data and Digital Scholarship](https://www.colorado.edu/crdds/), a collaboration between the University Libraries and Research Computing, offers services that can help you to fulfill all of these requirements. 

This brief primer provides an overview of these services, along with references to helpful external resources. It begins with an overview of [data management planning][An Overview of Data Management Planning]. It then presents [services and resources that can help you to implement data management best practices once your project is underway][Implementation Services], and an an introduction to [repository services][Repository Services] at CRDDS that can help you to publish your project data at the conclusion of your grant. The [conclusion][Conclusion] provides references and suggestions for further reading.
